    <p>Everyone has his passion, his own interests. With the excitement, you can do all day long without being bored. Sports are the common favorite of many and football is a popular sport, loved all over the world. Play football for health, fun and entertainment after the stressful hours of work and study.<br><br>Hobby is the favourite activity, habit when you do regulary in your free time for pleasure and enjoyment. What do you do in free time? My most favourite hobby is playing football in spare time. After completing my home work at home, I generally spend my lot of free time in playing football. I was so interested to play football from my childhood however started learning to play well when I was 5 years old. I was in one class when I was 5 years old. My father asked to my class teacher in the PTM about my hobby of football. And my teacher told him that there is a facility of playing sports daily in the school from class 1 so you can admit your child. Now, I really enjoy playing football and participate in the inter-school competitions.</p>

        <h1><a>My Favourite Books</a></h1>
            <div class="Division"></div>
            <p>Books are friends who never leave your side. I find this saying to be very true as books have always been there for me. I enjoy reading books. They have the power to help us travel through worlds without moving from our places. In addition, books also enhance our imagination. Growing up, my parents and teachers always encouraged me to read. They taught me the importance of reading. Subsequently, I have read several books. However, one boom that will always be my favourite is The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid. It is one of the most intriguing reads of my life. I have read all the books of this series, yet I read them again as I never get bored of it.<br><br>Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a series of fiction books written by the American author and cartoonist Jeff Kinney. All the main books are the journals of the main character, Greg Heffley. Befitting a teen's diary, the books are filled with simple drawings of Greg's daily adventures.

Since the release of the online version in May 2004, most of the books have garnered positive reviews and commercial success. As of 2021, more than 250 million copies have been sold globally.

The first, second, fourth and ninth installments have been adapted into films by 20th Century Fox.

The online game Poptropica, itself also created by Kinney, has released two islands themed after Diary of a Wimpy Kid, called Wimpy Wonderland and Wimpy Boardwalk.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid officially began when Kinney brought up an idea about a middle-school weakling named Greg Heffley, who wrote about his personal life. In May 2004, FunBrain and Kinney released an online version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The website made daily entries until June 2005. He worked on his book for almost eight years, before showing it to a publisher in New York.

In February 2006, during the New York Comic Con, Kinney signed a multi-book deal with publisher Harry N. Abrams, Inc., to turn Diary of a Wimpy Kid into a print series.

The book became an instant hit, and the online version received about 20 million views as of 2009. Nonetheless, many online readers requested a printed version; Kinney agreed, and in April 2007, Diary of a Wimpy Kid was published. To date, fifteen Wimpy Kid books have been released, plus one do-it-yourself book, and two movie diaries. A spin-off series is focused on Greg's best friend, Rowley Jefferson, and has three entries: Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal, Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly Adventure, and Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly Spooky Stories. In April 2009, TIME named Kinney one of The World's Most Influential People.</p>

            <img class="Image" src="https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cobra-Kai-is-the-Best-Thing-Youll-Watch-on-Netflix-in-2020.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1284&h=856&crop=1">
            <p>Cobra Kai is an American martial arts comedy-drama streaming television series based on the original Karate Kid films by Robert Mark Kamen. The series was created by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, and stars Ralph Macchio and William Zabka, who reprise their roles as Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence from the 1984 film The Karate Kid. Set 34 years later, Cobra Kai re-examines the "Miyagi-Verse" narrative from Johnny's point of view, his decision to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo, and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel. Cobra Kai also stars Courtney Henggeler, Xolo Maridueña, Tanner Buchanan, Mary Mouser, Jacob Bertrand, Gianni DeCenzo and Martin Kove.<br><br>

The series launched on YouTube Red in 2018, and the second season debuted in 2019. After production of season three was completed, and YouTube decided to cancel the series, Netflix picked it up in June 2020. The third season released on Netflix on January 1, 2021, although it had been renewed for a fourth season ahead of the third-season premiere. As of January 2021, Cobra Kai has been watched by 73 million Netflix member households between the three seasons.<br><br>Thirty-four years after his defeat in the 1984 All-Valley Karate Tournament, Johnny Lawrence, now in his 50s, works as a part-time handyman and lives in an apartment in Reseda, Los Angeles, having fallen far from the wealthy lifestyle in Encino that had been enabled by his verbally abusive step-father, Sid Weinberg. He has a son named Robby with his ex-wife Shannon Keene, but he abandoned them both when Robby was born as his mother Laura died shortly before Robby's birth. Johnny, admittedly, has never recovered from his breakup with his high school girlfriend, Ali Mills.<br><br>

After losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny uses karate to defend his teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz from a gang of bullies. Miguel, an asthmatic kid who lives with his Ecuadorian single mother Carmen and grandmother Rosa, asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo as a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with Daniel LaRusso. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership chain, is married to co-owner Amanda and has two children: Samantha and Anthony. Daniel is finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a kid when he lived in Reseda. However, after his friend and mentor Mr. Miyagi died, Daniel's struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother Lucille, his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with Amanda.<br><br>

Johnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts, including Miguel's newfound friends Aisha, Hawk, and initially Demetri, who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students Tommy, Bobby, Dutch, Jimmy and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by John Kreese. Johnny develops a bond with Miguel in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha. Johnny's efforts to reform Cobra Kai are threatened by the unexpected reappearance of Kreese, who aspires to bring the dojo back to its originally ruthless form.<br><br>

As a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso Auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel, who is unaware of the former's parentage. He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and befriends and eventually starts dating Samantha after her breakup with Miguel. She eventually joins her father's dojo, along with Demetri and a few other Cobra Kai defects. Miguel later begins dating a new Cobra Kai student, Tory, who becomes Sam's rival.<br><br>

After the violent aftermath of a school brawl that is fueled by the dojos and their rivalry, Miguel is accidentally crippled by Robby. Johnny finds that Kreese has taken Cobra Kai from him, prompting him to form his own dojo Eagle Fang. Robby is eventually sent to juvenile detention, and while Kreese continues to lead his students down darker paths, Daniel returns to Okinawa to help find balance, where he reunites with former love interest Kumiko and reformed former enemy Chozen. Johnny helps Miguel regain the use of his legs with his unconventional training techniques, and there's eventually a reunion between Ali, Johnny, and Daniel, where Ali finally puts their rivalry to rest. However, the rivalry between the three dojos eventually explodes as Cobra Kai fights Miyagi Do and Eagle Fang in a brutal brawl. Afterward, Johnny and Daniel face Kreese, who has successfully turned Robby over to Cobra Kai through manipulation. They all agree to settle the fate of the dojos and valley at the next All-Valley tournament. Throughout the season, flashbacks are also shown to Kreese's time in the Vietnam War, and how it led him to become the merciless and ruthless man he is.<br><br>

The story's development revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.</p>

            <div class="Division"></div>
            <p>Likable characters, high-energy fights, suburban melodrama and '80s dad-rock have fueled the three seasons of “Cobra Kai,” with a fourth already planned — and its semi-satirical approach to slinging nostalgia while expanding the “Karate Kid” mythology into a multigenerational saga has proved popular.</p>
